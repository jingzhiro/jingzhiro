<h1>Hey! I'm @jingzhiro :)</h1>

I'm in my second year of exploring my interests (computer science and physics) at UNSW and branching out into other areas of knowledge.

<h2>Projects</h2>

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as an introduction to web development. My website is currently in development.
