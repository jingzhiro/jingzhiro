<h1>Hey! I'm @jingzhiro :)</h1>

I'm in my second year of exploring computer science and physics and branching out into other areas of knowledge at UNSW.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Website</h3>
This website was an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. It was an insightful experience, giving a
